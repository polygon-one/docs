## Overview

The Polygon One API allows you to programmatically manage your EUDR compliance data. It is designed for server-to-server integration with your ERP system (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, etc.).

**What you can do with the API:**

- **Articles** — Create, update, and query articles. EUDR relevance is determined automatically from the HS code.
- **Suppliers** — Manage supplier data and link suppliers to articles.
- **Orders** — Import purchase and sale orders (single or batch). Orders can be auto-assigned to DDS statements.
- **DDS Statements** — Create and manage Due Diligence Statements for TRACES submission.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require a Bearer token. Generate your API key in the Polygon One dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Select the required permission scopes (e.g. `articles:read`, `orders:write`)
4. Copy the generated key

Include the key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer eudr_8f7d2a...
```

<Warning>
  API keys are secret credentials for server-to-server communication. Store them in environment variables and **never** expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://app.polygonone.com
```

## Permission Scopes

Each API key is assigned specific permission scopes that control access:

| Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `articles:read` | Read articles |
| `articles:write` | Create, update, delete articles |
| `suppliers:read` | Read suppliers |
| `suppliers:write` | Create, update, delete suppliers |
| `orders:read` | Read orders |
| `orders:write` | Create, update, delete orders |
| `dds:read` | Read DDS statements |
| `dds:write` | Create, update, delete DDS statements |

## Response Format

Successful responses return JSON data directly. List endpoints return arrays, single-resource endpoints return objects.

**Single resource creation** returns HTTP `201`:
```json
{
  "article": { "id": "...", "name": "..." }
}
```

**Batch imports** return HTTP `200` with a summary:
```json
{
  "imported": [{ "id": "...", "orderNumber": "ORD-001" }],
  "failed": [{ "orderNumber": "ORD-002", "error": "Supplier not found" }],
  "skipped": 0
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200` | **OK** — Request successful |
| `201` | **Created** — Resource created successfully |
| `400` | **Bad Request** — Invalid input data or validation errors |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** — Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | **Forbidden** — API key lacks required permissions, or account setup is incomplete |
| `404` | **Not Found** — Resource does not exist or does not belong to your company |
| `500` | **Internal Server Error** — Something went wrong on our end |

Error responses include an `error` field and optionally `details`:

```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": [{ "path": ["hsCode"], "message": "Commodity is required." }]
}
```
