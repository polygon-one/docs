## Welcome

This API allows you to programmatically manage your EUDR compliance data. It is designed to be integrated directly with your ERP system (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, etc.) for server-to-server communication.


## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens.

1.  Log in to your dashboard.
2.  Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**.
3.  Generate a new key.

Include this key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer eudr_8f7d2a...
```

<Warning>
  **Security Notice:** API Keys are secret tokens used to authenticate your application.
  They should be stored securely in your server's environment variables and **never** exposed in client-side code (browsers).
</Warning>

## Base URL

All requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.yourdomain.com
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200` | **OK** - The request was successful. |
| `400` | **Bad Request** - Invalid input data (e.g., malformed JSON or missing required fields). |

| `403` | **Forbidden** - The API key does not have permission to access this resource. |
| `422` | **Unprocessable Entity** - Validation failed (e.g., duplicate internal article number). |
