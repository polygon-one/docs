## What is Pre-Compliance?

Pre-Compliance is the process of collecting, validating, and analyzing all required data **before** creating Due Diligence Statements. This ensures your supply chain meets EUDR requirements and reduces the risk of rejected submissions.

## The Pre-Compliance Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Ingestion" icon="database">
    Import your articles and suppliers. The system uses **HS Codes** to automatically identify EUDR-relevant products, which then populate your Compliance Dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Supplier Onboarding" icon="users">
    Request evidence directly from partners. Suppliers receive a secure link to the **Supplier Portal** to submit geolocation data and legal documents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analysis & Validation" icon="satellite">
    Once data is submitted, the system triggers **automated satellite analysis** for deforestation and runs AI validation on uploaded documents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Report Generation" icon="file-circle-check">
    Generate audit-ready **EUDR Analysis Reports** for compliant articles to prove due diligence to authorities like the BLE.
  </Step>
</Steps>
