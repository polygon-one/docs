## Overview

Gather required evidence from your upstream partners. Navigate to the **Compliance Dashboard** to see a prioritized list of articles requiring analysis.

## Requesting Information

If you lack the necessary data for an article, you can request it immediately:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Article">
    In the Compliance Dashboard, identify an article/supplier pair with missing data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Request">
    Click **"Request Information"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Supplier Access">
    The supplier receives an email with a **secure link** to the dedicated **Supplier Portal**. No account creation is required for them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Suppliers Provide

In the Supplier Portal, your partners complete the following actions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Geolocation (Plots)" icon="map-location-dot">
    Suppliers provide the exact location of production by:
    - Drawing production plots directly on our interactive map.
    - Providing specific coordinates.
    - Uploading geospatial files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Legal Compliance" icon="file-contract">
    Suppliers establish legality by:
    - Answering a short compliance questionnaire.
    - Uploading required evidence (e.g., land use rights, environmental permits).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Automated Analysis

<Note>
Once a supplier submits their data, Polygon One **immediately triggers an automated satellite analysis** to check for deforestation and forest degradation on the submitted plots.
</Note>

## Handling Validations

Our system validates incoming data for plausibility.

*   **Rejections:** If AI flags a document (e.g., for "Country mismatch"), it is marked as **Rejected**.
*   **Corrections:** Use the **Messages tab** in the dashboard to contact the supplier directly and request corrected documents.
