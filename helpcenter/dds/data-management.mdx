## Overview

To link compliance results to real-world shipments, you must import your order data. Each order tracks the supplier, articles, and volumes involved.

## Import Methods

  <Tab title="CSV Import">
    **Best for batch processing.**

    You do not need to fit your data into a rigid template.
    1. Navigate to **Settings > CSV Imports**.
    2. Upload your own CSV file.
    3. **Map your columns** to Polygon One's fields (e.g., map your "Internal Article Nr" to our "Article ID").
    4. Run the import.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="REST API">
    **Best for automation.**

    Sync orders directly from your ERP system using our API.

## EUDR Relevance

The system uses the **HS Code** of the articles inside your orders to automatically determine if an order is **EUDR Relevant**.

<Info>
Only orders containing EUDR-relevant articles will appear in the specific filters for DDS assignment.

## Required Data Points

When importing orders, ensure you have the following data:

*   **Supplier:** Must match a supplier already in your database.
*   **Articles:** Must match existing article IDs.
*   **Volume:** The specific quantity (e.g., kg) for the order line item.
