## Overview

Navigate to the **Due Diligence Dashboard** to create formal compliance declarations. This process connects your compliant articles to specific volumes authorized for trade.

## Creating a DDS

Click **"Create DDS"** to start the multi-step wizard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="General Info">
    Select your **Activity Type**:
    *   **Import:** For goods entering the EU.
    *   **Export:** For goods leaving the EU.

    *Your company details (Name, Address, EORI) are pre-filled from your Settings.*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Supplier & Articles">
    Select the Supplier and the specific Articles to include in this statement.
    *   **Specify Volume:** You must enter the total **Volume (kg)** you are declaring for each article.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation & Signature">
    Review the summary and **sign the official declaration** by typing your full name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submission">
    Click Submit. The status will change from **Processing** to **Submitted**, and finally **Validated** once confirmed by EU TRACES.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
You must have your **EU TRACES Web Service Access Token** configured in Settings before submitting.
</Warning>

## Order Assignment

Once a DDS is **Validated**, you can assign commercial orders to it.

1.  Navigate to the **Orders** page.
2.  Click **"Assign to DDS"** on a relevant order.
3.  The system displays a list of valid DDS that:
    *   Match the Supplier.
    *   Contain the required Articles.
    *   Have enough **Remaining Volume**.

### Volume Tracking

Polygon One automatically tracks the **Assigned Volume** vs. the **Total DDS Volume**.
*   The system prevents you from assigning an order if it would exceed the remaining capacity of the DDS.

## Export for Customs

To clear customs, you need the official reference numbers.

1.  Go to the **Orders** page.
2.  Filter for your assigned orders.
3.  Click **"Export"**.

<Note>
The exported file includes both the **DDS Reference Number** AND the **Verification Number**. Both are required for customs clearance and border controls.
